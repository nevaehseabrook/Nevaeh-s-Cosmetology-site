      <p>A makeup artist is someone who does makeup for special occasions and events. To insure that it is made to your liking and your perfections. </p>
      <p>Makeup began in Egypt. Ancient Egyptians used copper and lead  to create the world's first cosmetics to the scientifically advanced products of today that can do just about any and everything to your skin; from hiding pores, smooth complexions, and even turn the pale green of your eyes to a vivid shade of emerald. Makeup has been apart of humankind for thousands of years. Over the centuries, many women used burnt matches to darken their eyes, berries to stain their lips and young boys' urine to fade their freckles. Some went to the extreme of even swallowing ox blood because of hearsay in attempts of brightening their complexion. </p>

      <p>Makeup first started in the United States in 1915, by  Maurice Levy who invented the metal container for lipstick. That invention gave Mass production it's license. Coco Chanel was influenced by &quot;The Flapper Style &quot;  of the 1920s, which embraced dark eyes, red lipstick, red nail polish, and the suntan. Chanel also became a well known makeup brand and has also became bigger with purses and perfume and other accessories as well. </p>
